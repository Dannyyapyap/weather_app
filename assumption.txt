Assumption: 
1) If user did not allow for tracking of location on browser, the default will be Singapore
2) API call will obtain lat and lon of Singapore by default
3) Limit will be set to 1 to display only 1 related search result 
4) Lat and Lon will be defaulted to Singapore Geographical location if not specified or detected
5) Epoch time will be converted to Singapore time
6) Geocoding API can only search for location via City name or Area Name. Therefore unable to search for country.
